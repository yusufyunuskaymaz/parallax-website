# parallax-website
- I made this web site in order to learn fixed backgrounds.
- It was hard to be aware of difference between section with opacity and non opacity.
- I gave purple to outline color but left side of it seemed like black but when I gave opacity it looked like gradient and purple.
- I used flex for layout instead of float.
